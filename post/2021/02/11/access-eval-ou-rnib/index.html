(PDF),
(2020)</a></p>
<p>This is one of three posts made today, prior to a zoom TeX Hour
tonight at 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time on accessible mathematics. The other
posts are <a href="../access-tools/">Accessibility Tools</a> and <a href="../blind-math-news/">Blind Math
News</a>. For more on the TeX Hour see
<a href="/contact/">contact</a>.</p>
<p>[Disclaimer: I used to work at the OU as a LaTeX expert.]</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Open University (OU) is the UK's largest provided of distance
learning. Many disabled people prefer distance learning, as their home
already has the adjustments required. The Royal National Institute of
Blind People (RNIB) is the UK's leading and largest community of blind
and partially sighted people.</p>
<p>In 2018 to 2019 the OU evaluated the accessibility of their learning
materials in mathematics and statistics. At the heart of the
evaluation was the RNIB providing first an expert assessment, and
second user testing. The OU's report on this evaluation was published
in February 2020, about a month prior to the first lockdown in the UK.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
<p>The report is a 29 page PDF document, produced using LaTeX. Its
authors are Chris Hughes, Chetz Colwell, John Clarke, Kaye Williams,
and Alison Bromley. The report is an OU document. It describes a
funded project that lasted a year. The external cost was £11,000, all
for expert consultancy provide by the RNIB.</p>
<p>This consultancy had two phases, expert assessment and user testing,
with a development phase between the two phases. (This is recognized
route for improving user experience.)</p>
<p>They found that 6 out of 8 users users would recommend studying using
material in this format to other maths or statistics students wanting
to study idependently at degree level.</p>
<p>Finally, based on the project the report recommends that the school of
Mathematics and Statistics use HTML + MathJax as tested as alternative
format across the curriculum in addition to its existing outputs. The
report propose that the output be named <em>Designed As A Reasonable
Adjustment</em> (<em>DAARA</em>).</p>
<p>The first 6 sections about about 2/3 of the report. They are</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Aims and scope</li>
<li>Activities</li>
<li>Findings</li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-1-introduction">Section 1: Introduction</h2>
<p>This section describes the use of DAISY talking
book at the OU, for Maths &amp; Stats courses. It references the OU
student charter and legal obligations on UK education providers. In
particular websites and mobile apps must be made <em>perceivable,
operable, understandable and robust</em>.</p>
<p>It defines these terms as</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>perceivable</strong> can the user clearly find and/or be told by their
assistive technology that there is mathematical content available to
them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>operable</strong> can they use their assistive technology to engage with
the mathematical conent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>understandable</strong> can the mathematical content be presented
meaningfully to the user so that it makes sense?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>robust</strong> can all of the above be done reliably so that the user
can be confident that mathematical content will always be presented
to them in this way with minimal failures, changes, and
inaccuracies?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2-background">Section 2: Background</h2>
<p>This is a major section. First it gives a history, starting with
Larry's speakeasy (1983) and finishing with the <code>axessibility</code> package
of Armano et al. In between are the technologies MathML, MathJax and
PDF/UA. Also mentioned are papers based on the experience of blind
students by Karshmer and Bledsoe; Ferreira and Freitas; Cooper, Lowe,
and Taylor; Cliffe; Godfrey and Loots.</p>
<p>It gives a short summary of approaches to making math content
accessible.  It also gives a longer summary of the experience of
screen readers, NVDA and ePUB.</p>
<h2 id="section-3-aims-and-scope">Section 3: Aims and scope</h2>
<p>The report states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aim of this project was to evaluate, and develop, an alternative
format that is specifically designed for screen reader users who wish
to independently engage and interact with mathematical content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It further states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We decided to approach the RNIB, as their ‘tried and tested’
certification can be seen as something of a ‘kite mark’. The initial
discussions with the RNIB made it clear that the ‘tried and tested’
certification would only be possible if the evaluation included
testing of our VLE sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were keen to keep the project focused on our alternative format,
so abandoned the goal of achieving certification; we were, however,
confident that the RNIB’s testing process would provide us with
helpful information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding from this they formulated <em>requirements of the alternative
format</em>, and made an <em>alternative format choice</em>. They chose HTML,
with <strong>mathematical content written in MathML, rendered using
MathJax</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="section-4-activities">Section 4: Activities</h2>
<p>This is a major section.  As stated earlier, the RNIB provided first
an expert assessment and then user testing (with a phase of
development between).</p>
<p>This section contains considerable useful detail as to what was done,
and by whom. I find it helpful to think of this section and the next
(Findings) as describing (or providing) the evidence, that making the
changes described would substantially improve the access blind and
visually impaired students would have to the teaching materials.</p>
<h2 id="section-5-findings">Section 5: Findings</h2>
<p>This is a major section, containing considerable detail. In
particularly, it contains summaries of participants stated experience
of reading and interacting with the elements on the page.</p>
<p>Noteworthy (and helpfully starred in the report) are</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology problems between different sites somewhat derailed the
first user test. It was solved by changing computers.</li>
<li>Participants liked that it was easy to interact with the maths, and
then escape.</li>
<li>The different [tree] levels in the document participants found took
a little getting used to.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, some parts of usability are obvious, but for others the
devil is in the detail. Or in other words, the details are important
and so success requires more time and effort than expected. Reading
this section will make this abstract statement considerably more
concrete.</p>
<p>Again in my view, careful observation of user experience and listening
to user comments is an important part of usability testing. It's also
a major part of the scientific method when conduction
experiments. Usability testing is a form of experiment.</p>
<h2 id="section-6-conclusions">Section 6: Conclusions</h2>
<p>From the conclusions I highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, the first version that we submitted to the RNIB in
December 2018 was not fit for purpose, and we learned a lot from
resolving the 36 issues [the RNIB found].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We must expect there to be a learning curve for any users of such an
output. … [W]e must ensure that training documentation is
available for [our students] for reference at any point.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>any potential users [of NVDA] would need a dedicated training
session.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>producing MathML from LATEX code is straight forward, however,
producing MathML that works well and reliably in such a way that it
can be engaged with using assistive technology requires care.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there are likely to be many technical challenges in implementing
such an output, and it is not likely that we will be able to simply
‘flick a switch’ or ‘press a button’ and deploy the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there are likely to be other, as yet unknown, challenges to the
implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the report restates the recommendation, that the school of
Mathematics and Statistics use HTML + MathJax as tested as alternative
format across the curriculum in addition to its existing outputs.</p>
<p>The report proposes that the output be named <em>Designed As A Reasonable
Adjustment</em> (<em>DAARA</em>).</p>
