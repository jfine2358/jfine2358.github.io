<h2 id="last-week-accessible-mathematics">Last week Accessible Mathematics</h2>
<p>Accessible mathematics was last week's topic. It was a special TeX
Hour in several ways. Over 20 people came, people got to know each
other, and important topics were discussed. Several of the
participants were blind users of TeX, and they described their
experience and problems. I suggested we have another similar meeting
not next month, but in April or May.</p>
<p>Here are some posts from last week.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="post/2021/02/11/access-eval-ou-rnib/">Accessibility Evaluation: Open University and RNIB</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="video-recording">Video recording</h3>
<p>Last week's meeting was the first to be recorded. I gratefully
acknowledge funding from the UK TeX Users Group. They're paying for 3
months of a Zoom license, so that I can record the meetings on the
cloud. For clarity, the TeX Hour is not a UK TUG event.</p>
<p>The first 20 minutes of this TeX Hour was the participants introducing
themselves to each other. This by itself is fascinating, and well
worth listening to. There's such a diversity of experience and
interests shown.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJWndkDema4&amp;ab_channel=JonathanFine">TeX Hour: Accessible Mathematics: 11 Feb 2021
(YouTube)</a></p>
<h2 id="this-week-input-conversion-and-output-formats">This week Input, Conversion and Output formats</h2>
<p>Input, conversion and output formats will be the topic this week
(today, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time). The zoom details are on the <a href="/contact">contact
page</a>. I'm not expecting more than 5 or 10 people, because
I've not had time to publish interesting blog posts.</p>
<p>There seem to be two architectures. The first is A -&gt; B, A -&gt; C, A -&gt;
D etc.  The second is X -&gt; Y, for all values of X and Y. I'll explain</p>
<h3 id="latex-to-everything">LaTeX to everything</h3>
<p>We write are documents in LaTeX (or some other TeX markup
language). And so for LaTeX authors the useful conversion tools are</p>
<ul>
<li>LaTeX to PDF (of course)</li>
<li>LaTeX to HTML (of course)</li>
<li>LaTeX to XML (for those that like it)</li>
<li>LaTeX to everything</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="python-docs">Python docs</h3>
<p>The Python docs used to be written in LaTeX, and converted to HTML for
web use. This was done using a customising the best tool then
available. This starting point was
<a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/latex2html/manual.html">LaTeX2HTML</a>,
developed by Nikos Drakos in 1996.</p>
<h3 id="now-rst-to-everything">Now, RST to everything</h3>
<p>LaTeX2HTML worked well for a long time. But as the Python community
grew, then wanted more, so they moved house.  For good reason the
Python Documentation Special Interest Group wanted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a markup syntax and toolset to allow auto-documentation, where the
docstrings of Python systems can be extracted in context and
processed into useful, high-quality documentation for multiple
purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the Python community made a big effort to develop and switch to
a new format ReStructured Text (RST). For background <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/">PEP 287 &ndash;
reStructuredText Docstring
Format</a>.</p>
<p>And now the Python conversion tools are</p>
<ul>
<li>RST to LaTeX (and hence PDF)</li>
<li>RST to HTML</li>
<li>RST to EPUB</li>
<li>RST to plain text</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="now-everything-to-everything">Now, everything to everything</h3>
<p>Notice that now LaTeX is both an input format (for heavy mathematics
and other purposes) and an output format (for the Python docs). And
there are other examples. Sometimes XML is an input format. Sometimes
it's an output format.</p>
<p>This makes <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> very interesting. So far as I
know, it's the most widely used text-based conversion system for which
the social value is proportional to square of the work put into it.</p>
<p>The creator of Pandoc spoke at last year's TUG conference.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9uZJFO54iM&amp;ab_channel=TeXUsersGroup">TUG 2020:
John MacFarlane: Pandoc for TeXnicians
(YouTube)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="phones-faxs-network-effect-metcalfes-law">Phones, faxs, network effect, Metcalfe's law</h3>
<p>A telephone is useful only if you know someone else who has a
telephone. And if you do, they can call you and you can call them. The
same goes for fax machines.</p>
<p>These are examples of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">Network effect
(wikipedia)</a> and of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe's Law
(wikipedia)</a>, which
states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the value [to society] of a telecommunications network is
proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the
system ($n^2$)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If our phone network use the A -&gt; B, A -&gt; C, A -&gt; D architecture then
its economic cost is proportional to $n^2$. In other words, social
value and economic cost are proportional.</p>
<p>But local phone networks use an eXchange, which I'll denote by X. And
now our phone network need only have lines A -&gt; X, B -&gt; X and so
forth. And now the social value is proportional to the square of the
economic cost.</p>
<p>Hence my statement about pandoc.</p>
<h2 id="next-week-archival-documents-and-software">Next week, Archival Documents and Software</h2>
<p>Being archival is core quality and value of TeX. In 1990 Don Knuth announced</p>
<h3 id="tex-development-is-at-an-end">TeX development is at an <code>\end</code>.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My work on developing  METAFONT, and Computer Modern has come to
an end. I will make no further changes except to correct extremely
serious bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tex-is-public-domain-same-across-space">TeX is public domain, same across space</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I have put these systems into the public domain so that people
everywhere can use the ideas freely if they wish. I have also spent
thousands of hours trying to ensure that the systems produce
essentially identical results on all computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="fixed-points-have-great-value">Fixed points have great value</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly believe that an unchanging system has great value, even
though it is axiomatic that any complex system can be
improved. Therefore I believe that it is unwise to make further
&ldquo;improvements&rdquo; to the systems called TeX and METAFONT.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="same-across-time">Same across time</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us regard these systems as fixed points, which should give the
same results 100 years from now that they produce today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these quotes are taken from <a href="https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf">Don Knuth: The Future of TeX and
Metafont (1990),
(PDF)</a></p>
<h2 id="next-month">Next month</h2>
<p>The TeX Hour is settling into a monthly cycle. All meetings are
Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time, and are on Zoom.</p>
<ul>
<li>First Thursday: <strong>Beginners</strong> (to math and to whole documents)</li>
<li>Second Thursday: <strong>Accessibility</strong> (with a focus on math)</li>
<li>Third Thursday: <strong>Conversion</strong> (including typesetting)</li>
<li>Fourth Thursday: <strong>Durability</strong> (of documents and software)</li>
</ul>
<p>And in April, July, September and December this year we have</p>
<ul>
<li>Fifth Thursday: <strong>X</strong> (explore, experiment, expand, the unknown)</li>
</ul>
<p>This cycle will persist for as long as it's useful, and there's
nothing better.</p>
<h2 id="a-tex-alphabet-for-the-monthly-cycle">A TeX alphabet for the monthly cycle</h2>
<p>By design the initial letters for the monthly cycle are <strong>A, B, C, D
and X</strong>. In other words, an alphabet, similar to &ldquo;A is for Apple&rdquo; and
&ldquo;B is for Ball&rdquo;.  Here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A is for Accessibility</li>
<li>B is for Beginners</li>
<li>C is for Conversion</li>
<li>D is for Durable (and Document)</li>
<li>X is for eXplore, eXperiment, eXpand and the unknown</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-b-before-a">Why B before A?</h2>
<p>Even though Accessibility comes before Beginners, the monthly cycle is
B, A, C, D and perhaps X. Why?  Here are some reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The start of a story at the beginning. (And <code>\begin</code> is a LaTeX command.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessibility means that some object is accessible to someone. We
need an object and a user. Then we ask the user: Can you access the
object?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that saying &ldquo;person with disability&rdquo; is more respectful
than &ldquo;disabled person&rdquo;.  It reminds me that a person is a person, even
if they have a disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think B, A, C, D works better as a monthly cycle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading to the end of this long post. I hope that it's
done no harm, and that some of it helps someone somehow.</p>
