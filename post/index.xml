      <description>Summmary Last week I wrote to the Blind Math mailing list announcing a zoom TeX Hour tonight at 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time on accessible mathematics. I also wrote
 Many teachers use LaTeX for course materials. I&#39;d like to have real-world examples of LaTeX math, and accessibility problems and solutions. Please send to this list or to me privately as you wish.
 In this post I summarise the responses.</description>

      <description>Summary In February 2020 the UK&#39;s Open University (OU), working with the The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), produced a practical report on accessibility of mathematical content.
This post provides a high level precis of the report. Its focus is on helping you which part of the report, if any, are relevant to you. I hope it encourages you to read this well-written report on carefully considered research.</description>

      <description>Social media This post is about writing math formulas in LaTeX, for use on social media web-sites such as math discussion forums. We focus on the experience users have, particularly those who&#39;ve not used LaTeX before.
There&#39;s much more to social media than Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat and LinkedIn. There&#39;s specialist sites such as forums, wikis and Q+A sites (such as StackExchange). There&#39;s even a social media site (recommended) for all about apples, pears, plums, and cherries - and orchards where they are grown (URL is below).</description>

      <description>Summary We look at some recent posts on the Blind Math mailing list. My main conclusion as a TeX developer is that many on that list prefer accessible HTML to accessible PDF. This is something that TeX developers need to be aware of.
If you&#39;re interested in this topic you&#39;re invited to drop in to my TeX Office Hour (every Thursday evening 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time).

      <description>Summary We all know that TeX has large use cases, such as research math and physics. This post is about how TeX might help some small niche use cases. We study one example, and suggest how it might scale to others. The scaling depend on non-TeX software and systems, such as web frameworks, and server / cloud computing.

      <description>About This is the first of a series of occassional pages on fun. It might be jokes and humour. Or puzzles.
Resolutions My New Year&#39;s resolution, besides staying alive, is to finish reading Procrastination for Beginners. Once done with that some self-improvement: The Bluffer Guide to Self-Knowledge.
Tom Gauld I very much enjoy the Tom Gauld&#39;s wry cultural cartoons on The Guardian newspaper. Here&#39;s a couple of recent ones I&#39;ve really liked:</description>

      <description>Why TeX Office Hours? The UK TeX Users Group is close to folding. It is a closed (paid membership only) organisation. I think it&#39;s time for an open to all UK TeX grouping. To help set this up, I&#39;m holding a TeX Office Hour every Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm, until the end of March.
I&#39;m also happy to discuss Python, mathematics and other matters, but TeX (and MathJax) has priority.</description>

      <description>The question Last week a member of UK TUG asked me, by email, what were my top 5 beautiful books produced using TeX. I think you might be interested in my answer. Here it is, lightly edited.
The answer Thank you for your email. Your question surprised me, probably because my experience and history is different from yours.
The book Concrete Mathematics (by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik) is for me special.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve got just 15 weeks! Summary The UK Tex Users Group (UK TUG) is in perhaps terminal decline. For several years a poorly attended AGM and distribution of DVDs was all it did. That&#39;s here, where we are.
I want to be somewhere better. That&#39;s there. Less of the original paying-membership and print-centric model. Less focus on paper and PDF typography. More focus on web pages, interaction and accessibility. And open-membership.</description>

      <description>The message below was today posted to the comp.text.newsgroup.
Grouping of UK LaTeX editors, proof-readers and the like Richard Hutchinson and Jonathan Webley are both freelance editors with a special interest in LaTeX. Jonathan Fine is a past Chair of the UK TeX Users Group. All three of us are interested in forming a UK-focused informal grouping of LaTeX editors, proofreaders and the like.

      <description>There are many online tutors for learning to type. They&#39;re useful. Here&#39;s one, that helps new LaTeX users learn and practice subscripts and superscripts. (It uses an instant-preview widget, based on MathJax.)
Although only a proof-of-concept prototype, it might already good enough to help some people. And perhaps inspire others.
Subscripts and superscripts The lesson starts here. The basics are:
 use underscore &amp;lsquo;_&amp;rsquo; for subscript use caret &amp;lsquo;^&amp;rsquo; for superscript.</description>

      <description>Here we look at what makes the LaTeX Typing Tutor works, and future plans.
User experience I&#39;m an expert. Not a typical user. I&#39;d really like feedback, and personal experience, from people who are learning LaTeX. And the less they know about LaTeX to begin with, the better!
Content The typing tutor is a platform for the delivery of training content. Under the hood, it has a list of examples.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I met about twenty others at the London Scholarly Tech Meetup. It was good. It was my first time. A varied group mostly, it seemed to me, working for publishers of scholarly books and journals. And in related areas, such as the online LaTeX platform Overleaf. It seemed, although I&#39;m not in a position to judge, that much of the group were interested in workflow and data-flow innovation and improvement.</description>

      <description>Survival Just two days ago the UK TeX Users Group survived its greatest threat. It was a threat to its very existence. At the AGM there was a motion to dissolve the organisation. And if passed, it would have sent all of UK TUG&#39;s funds (Â£13,000) to the German and US TeX User Groups.
This motion was defeated 9 votes to 20, with 7 abstentions. (Most of the votes were emailed in.</description>

      <description>About this statement I&#39;m standing for Chair of the UK TeX Users Group. There are two candidates. The other is Jay Hammond. Both of us are long-standing members of committee of UK TUG. Today the candidate statements are circulated to members. Mine is below. (Jay&#39;s is available here.)
If you&#39;re a TeX user in the UK, please read my statement. This election affects you. Maybe not right now, but in a year or two its consequences will be felt.</description>

      <description>Introduction As an experiment, I&#39;ve decided to search for activity in the academia part of UK TeX user community. My research method is simple.
I use a custom web search (using Google), with:
 Query: site:ac.uk latex Date range: 1st July to 30 September 2019  I then visit the sites listed on the first page of search results. If the search returns more than one page for a site (Durham), I use only one.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s a lot going on right now in UK TUG. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not about promoting and supporting the use of TeX in the UK. It&#39;s about politics. It&#39;s about who&#39;s in charge. And about future direction.
There&#39;s a contested election for Chair. The first in a long time. (I&#39;m one of the candidates. Here&#39;s my statement.)
There are motions at the AGM related to the dissolution of UK TUG, and distributing its assets.</description>

      <title>Why 2358?</title>

      <guid>/post/2019/10/22/why-2358/</guid>
      <description>The number 2358 isn&#39;t random. I chose 2358 because 2,3,5,8 are Fibonacci numbers. This is clearer when we write 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Notice that each number is the sum of the two previous. So the next numbers in the sequence are 13, 21, 34, 55.
I choose the Fibonacci numbers because their important in my math research. They appear as the dimensions of a graded ring that is of great importance, at least to me.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a static site generator. To begin with all web sites were static. But now we have web content management systems, such as WordPress. Each approach has advantages and problems. Many things are best of their class, provided you choose the criteria carefully.
It&#39;s easy to archive a static site. One simply makes a back-up of its files. But to archive a WordPress site, you also need to archive the content of a database, and the software that delivers the content.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today I submitted my preprint Linear homology in a nutshell to the Arxiv. I&#39;ve spent about half my life (i.e. since 1985) working on it, so I call it my half-life problem. I hope it&#39;s now more than half-done. The abstract is below. If some wise person had suggested years ago that I investigate the ideas expressed in the abstract, I&#39;d have made much quicker progress. (Links at foot of page.</description>
