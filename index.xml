      <description>About this statement I&amp;rsquo;m standing for Chair of the UK TeX Users Group. There are two candidates. The other is Jay Hammond. Both of us are long-standing members of committee of UK TUG. Today the candidate statements are circulated to members. Mine is below. (I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a link to Jay&amp;rsquo;s, when available.)
If you&amp;rsquo;re a TeX user in the UK, please read my statement. This election affects you. Maybe not right now, but in a year or two its consequences will be felt.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on right now in UK TUG. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not about promoting and supporting the use of TeX in the UK. It&amp;rsquo;s about politics. It&amp;rsquo;s about who&amp;rsquo;s in charge. And about future direction.
There&amp;rsquo;s a contested election for Chair. The first in a long time. (I&amp;rsquo;m one of the candidates. Here&amp;rsquo;s my statement.)
There are motions at the AGM related to the dissolution of UK TUG, and distributing its assets.</description>

      <title>Why 2358?</title>
      <link>/post/2019/10/22/why-2358/</link>

      <description>The number 2358 isn&amp;rsquo;t random. I chose 2358 because 2,3,5,8 are Fibonacci numbers. This is clearer when we write 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Notice that each number is the sum of the two previous. So the next numbers in the sequence are 13, 21, 34, 55.
I choose the Fibonacci numbers because their important in my math research. They appear as the dimensions of a graded ring that is of great importance, at least to me.</description>

      <title>Why did I choose Hugo?</title>

      <description>Hugo is a static site generator. To begin with all web sites were static. But now we have web content management systems, such as WordPress. Each approach has advantages and problems. Many things are best of their class, provided you choose the criteria carefully.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to archive a static site. One simple makes a back-up of its files. But to archive a WordPress site, you also need to archive the content of a database, and the software that delivers the content.</description>
